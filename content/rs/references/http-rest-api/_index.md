You can use the Redis Enterprise REST API to programatically manage a Redis Software cluster, including:

- Adding, configuring, and removing nodes
- Adding, configuring, and removing databases
- Adding, managing, and removing users

The REST API lets you access these actions with RESTful HTTP requests so that you can develop an application to automate the actions.
In addition, with the REST API, as with rladmin,
you have access to a wider range of options than in the web UI so you can better customize RS for your requirements.
